# 1. Introduction 

***Introduction***

- Critical & evidence based reflection on the original paper + new research questions that i have created.

# 2.Data & Methods 

## 2.1. Data 

**Dataset:** The idea was taken from challenge project which aimed at identifying bullying causes in Finnish schools. The data set is private and accessible via emailing the author as the students are under 18 therefore private information is kept secure (~ find policy around this).

**Number of observations:** 3500 


- Descriptive tables 
- The data used - how it was manipulated and variables 
 
 
## 2.2. Methods 

- transparency of altered data and analysis of the new theory 


# 3. Results 

- code and all graphs/tables (original and improved)
- Be transparent - from original tables/graphs to new ones


# 4. Conclusion 

- summaries whats found
- transparency of evidence found/used 
- Limitations of project (is there a gap in literature & any need for further research)
